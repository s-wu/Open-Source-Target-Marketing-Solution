##Challenge #1: Open Source Target Marketing Solution (Open Data Delaware)


**Solve For:** Local retail businesses that want to better understand local market expansion but lack access to existing business intelligence tools.


**Example Solution Direction:** Create a web app to inform local business expansion based on open data publicly available trends.


**Use-Case Overview:** Imagine that you are a retailer and are looking to grow your business by adding a new location. How could you make sure that you are choosing the optimal location for your expansion?  You would already have a strong idea of who your target market is, particularly their demographic information. Create a tool that would allow for a small business to identify a location to expand based upon local demographic. Points for making something that could be shared with other communities with their own data and resources.


**Possible Technical Needs:** multiple data source integration; machine learning;  database management; mapping; scoring and charting.
